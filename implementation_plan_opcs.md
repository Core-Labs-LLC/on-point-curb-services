# Implementation Plan

### Objective

I am building a website for my new client, On Point Curb Services https://www.onpointcurbservices.com/

On Point Curb Services provides professional curb painting and residential address marking services, specializing in refreshing and painting house address numbers directly on curbs, adding reflective address markers, custom logos, and decorative designs for homeowners in Austin, TX and surrounding areas including Cedar Park, Leander, Killeen, and Round Rock. Their work uses durable paints and reflective materials to enhance visibility and curb appeal.

They work with homeowners and residents who want clear, attractive, and long-lasting curb address markers and custom curb designs that improve visibility for guests, emergency responders, and delivery personnel while also adding a personalized touch to their property. On Point Curb Services emphasizes attention to detail, custom options, and customer satisfaction in every project.

The goal of this website is to showcase my client On Point Curb Services as a reputable, professional, and effective curb painting and address marking provider that a prospective client should work with, and to provide clear CTAs for a prospective client to connect with On Point Curb Services about scheduling their curb address painting, reflective markers, or custom design services.

### Design

Redesign this landing page to look like it was built by a top-tier modern design agency charging $50k+. Focus on:

- Subtle, sophisticated animations (micro-interactions, smooth transitions)
- A cohesive, premium color palette (avoid anything that feels "template-y")
- Polished details: shadows, gradients, borders that feel intentional and high-end
- Visual rhythm and alignment that feels considered
- Please do animation on every number on each page from 0 and count up when it scrolls into view
- Use refined typography that aligns with the company’s industry and brand identity

The only constraints are to use the attached logo in the navbar, apply fonts suited for a modern layout, follow the original website’s color theme, and ensure any hero stock imagery aligns with their core services or products.

### Copywriting

Take full liberty with the copywriting for this website. In the client's own words, this is how they describe themselves and their services. This information needs to be conveyed in a way that is marketed and comes across well to the user on the website.
